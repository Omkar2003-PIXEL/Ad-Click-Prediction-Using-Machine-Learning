Ad Click Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting ad click-through rates (CTR) using machine learning. The dataset consists of 10 features, including Daily Time Spent on Site, Age, Area Income, Daily Internet Usage, Ad Topic Line, City, Gender, Country, Timestamp, and the target variable Clicked on Ad. Using Logistic Regression, we predict whether a user will click on an ad based on their demographics and behavior. This helps search engines rank ads effectively by combining the probability of a click with the advertiserâ€™s bid, thereby optimizing revenue and improving ad targeting.

We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns such as how time spent on-site or ad topic affects user clicks, along with demographic influences like age, gender, and location. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world advertising problems, providing insights into user behavior and building a foundation for ad recommendation systems and revenue optimization.
